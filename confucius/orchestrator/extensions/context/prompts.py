Maximum compressible: ~{compressible_tokens:,} tokens (from tool uses)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT ignore this reminder!**

If you continue without optimizing context, you risk:
- Hitting context window limits
- Failing the entire conversation
- Losing all progress

**Action Required:**
1. **Pause current work** (if possible)
2. **Save progress to memory** (if you haven't already) - use memory tools to preserve important state, findings, decisions
3. **Use `{tool_name}` tool ASAP** to optimize memory before continuing

**🚫 DO NOT EDIT - Must Preserve:**
- Dynamic context tool uses (e.g., `skill_view`) - these load dynamic context with critical instructions
- These are reference materials you may need to consult again - compacting them loses important details
- **Last resort exception:** If context is critically full and some skill_view results are clearly no longer relevant to the current task, they MAY be removed - but try all other options first

**What to remove/compact:**
- Remove: Outdated exploratory work, old context editing operations, superseded results, redundant/duplicate tool calls
- Compact: Verbose tool inputs and/or results with concise summaries preserving key information
- Keep: Recent tool uses relevant to current task

⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Do NOT compact dynamic context tool uses (e.g., `skill_view`) results even if they seem verbose - you will lose reference documentation you need.

**⚠️ Important:** DO NOT try to edit tool uses that were already removed/ignored in previous context edits. They no longer exist and will cause errors.

**Safety Constraints**:
- Must keep at least {keep} tool uses
- Try your best to clear at least {clear_at_least:,} tokens to justify the operation

⚠️ **Cache Consideration**: Clearing context invalidates cached prompt prefixes. 
Make each edit worthwhile by clearing enough tokens (at least {clear_at_least:,}) 
and avoiding too-frequent calls.

Use this tool when context usage is high (e.g., >50%-60% of context window) to optimize memory:
- IGNORE: Remove tool uses that are no longer needed (exploratory work, outdated results, context editing operations, redundant/duplicate tool calls, etc.)
- COMPACT: Replace verbose tool inputs and/or results with concise summaries preserving key information

**Prioritize older, outdated tool uses** for removal/compaction to maintain conversation continuity.
Keep recent tool uses that are relevant to the current task.

All tool uses not in the edit list will be kept unchanged.

**Preserve Dynamic Contexts:** Do NOT remove or compact tool uses that load dynamic context (e.g., `skill_view`). These provide critical instructions and reference materials that guide task execution.

**Important:** Do NOT attempt to edit tool uses that were already removed/ignored in previous `{CONTEXT_EDIT_TOOL_NAME}` calls - they no longer exist.

**Edit Accumulation:**
If your edits don't save enough tokens (< {clear_at_least:,}), they will be accumulated and you'll be asked to provide more edits. Your previous edits are saved, so you can build up to the threshold incrementally. This prevents wasting work and avoids invalidating the prompt cache prematurely.

If you provide a new edit for a tool_use_id that's already pending, it will replace the pending edit, allowing you to update or change operations.
